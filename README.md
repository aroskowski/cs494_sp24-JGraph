# cs494_sp24-JGraph

This directory creates a floorplan from user input.

The floorplan itself is created with jgraph, and a few predefined postscript files to make up parts like the doorways. 
User input is taken and processed in python which outputs directly to the jgraph, to generate the actual output.
